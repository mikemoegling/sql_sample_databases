# sql_sample_databases
A collection of SQL databases and database sets with analytical code for multiple database formats.

The purpose of this repository is to collect data and build misc data from public sources into sets to build databases for testing and examples using fun and interesting data topics for programmers and learning.  

To be honest, I hate the generic examples used in the code examples and to get good at business analytics, it takes practice and the learning of lots of techniques.  I am using this project to both learn and explore myself.  

Plans are for DB platforms
SQL Server
DB2 for IBMi
MySQL
Oracle DBMS
